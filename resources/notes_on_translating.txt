Todo: how does it work in Pyside?

The pylupdate4 tool parses the source code of the files specified in iep.pro
and detects usages of a translate() function call.

From the PyQt website:

  * The programmer uses pylupdate4 to create or update a .ts translation 
    file for each language that the application is to be translated into. 
    A .ts file is an XML file that contains the strings to be translated 
    and the corresponding translations that have already been made. 
    pylupdate4 can be run any number of times during development to update 
    the .ts files with the latest strings for translation.
  * The translator uses Qt Linguist to update the .ts files with translations 
    of the strings. 
  * The release manager then uses Qt’s lrelease utility to 
    convert the .ts files to .qm files which are compact binary equivalents 
    used by the application. If an application cannot find an appropriate .qm 
    file, or a particular string hasn’t been translated, then the strings used 
    in the original source code are used instead.
