.. IEP documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to IEP's documentation!
===============================

API docs in progress.

IEP is organized in several subpackages, some of which can be used completely 
independent from the rest. Although IEP the IDE requires Qt and Python 3, 
some of its subpackages can safely be imported without these dependencies...

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   
   codeeditor/index
   yoton/index
