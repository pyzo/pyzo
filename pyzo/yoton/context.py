class Context(object):
    """Context(verbose=0, queue_params=None)

    A context represents a node in the network. It can connect to
    multiple other contexts (using a yoton.Connection.
    These other contexts can be in
    another process on the same machine, or on another machine
    connected via a network or the internet.

    This class represents a context that can be used by channel instances
    to communicate to other channels in the network. (Thus the name.)

    The context is the entity that queue routes the packages produced
    by the channels to the other context in the network, where
    the packages are distributed to the right channels. A context queues
    packages while it is not connected to any other context.

    If messages are send on a channel registered at this context while
    the context is not connected, the messages are stored by the
    context and will be send to the first connecting context.

    Example 1
    ---------
    # Create context and bind to a port on localhost
    context = yoton.Context()
    context.bind('localhost:11111')
    # Create a channel and send a message
    pub = yoton.PubChannel(context, 'test')
    pub.send('Hello world!')

    Example 2
    ---------
    # Create context and connect to the port on localhost
    context = yoton.Context()
    context.connect('localhost:11111')
    # Create a channel and receive a message
    sub = yoton.SubChannel(context, 'test')
    print(sub.recv() # Will print 'Hello world!'

    Queue params
    ------------
    The queue_params parameter allows one to specify the package queues
    used in the system. It is recommended to use the same parameters
    for every context in the network. The value of queue_params should
    be a 2-element tuple specifying queue size and discard mode. The
    latter can be 'old' (default) or 'new', meaning that if the queue
    is full, either the oldest or newest messages are discarted.

    def bind(self, address, max_tries=1, name=""):
        """bind(address, max_tries=1, name='')

        Setup a connection with another Context, by being the host.
        This method starts a thread that waits for incoming connections.
        Error messages are printed when an attempted connect fails. the
        thread keeps trying until a successful connection is made, or until
        the connection is closed.

        Returns a Connection instance that represents the
        connection to the other context. These connection objects
        can also be obtained via the Context.connections property.

        Parameters
        ----------
        address : str
            Should be of the shape hostname:port. The port should be an
            integer number between 1024 and 2**16. If port does not
            represent a number, a valid port number is created using a
            hash function.
        max_tries : int
            The number of ports to try; starting from the given port,
            subsequent ports are tried until a free port is available.
            The final port can be obtained using the 'port' property of
            the returned Connection instance.
        name : string
            The name for the created Connection instance. It can
            be used as a key in the connections property.

        Notes on hostname
        -----------------
        The hostname can be:
          * The IP address, or the string hostname of this computer.
          * 'localhost': the connections is only visible from this computer.
            Also some low level networking layers are bypassed, which results
            in a faster connection. The other context should also connect to
            'localhost'.
          * 'publichost': the connection is visible by other computers on the
            same network. Optionally an integer index can be appended if
            the machine has multiple IP addresses (see socket.gethostbyname_ex).
