## Package class


class Package(object):
    """Package(data, slot, source_id, source_seq, dest_id, dest_seq, recv_seq)

    Represents a package of bytes to be send from one Context instance
    to another. A package consists of a header and the encoded message.

    To make this class as fast as reasonably possible, its interface
    is rather minimalistic and few convenience stuff is implemented.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : bytes
        The message itself.
    slot : long
        The slot at which the package is directed. The integer is a hash of
        a string slot name.
    source_id : long
        The id of the context that sent this package.
    source_seq : long
        The sequence number of this package, counted at the sending context.
        Together with source_id, this fully identifies a package.
    dest_id : long (default 0)
        The id of the package that this package replies to.
    dest_seq : long (default 0)
        The sequence number of the package that this package replies to.
    recv_seq : long (default 0)
        The sequence number of this package counted at the receiving context.
        This is used to synchronize channels.

    When send, the header is composed of four control bytes, the slot,
    the source_id, source_seq, dest_id and dest_seq.

    Notes
    -----
    A package should always have content. Packages without content are only
    used for low-level communication between two ContextConnection instances.
    The source_seq is then used as the signal. All other package attributes
    are ignored.
