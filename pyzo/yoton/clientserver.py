""" yoton.clientserver.py

Yoton comes with a small framework to setup a request-reply pattern
using a client-server model (over a non-persistent connection),
similar to telnet. This allows one process to easily ask small pieces
of information from another process.

To create a server, create a class that inherits from
yoton.RequestServer and implement its handle_request() method.

A client process can simply use the yoton.do_request function.
Example: ``yoton.do_request('www.google.com:80', 'GET http/1.1\\r\\n')``

The client server model is implemented using one function and one class:
yoton.do_request and yoton.RequestServer.

Details
-------

The server implements a request/reply pattern by listening at a socket.
Similar to telnet, each request is handled using a connection
and the socket is closed after the response is send.

The request server can setup to run in the main thread, or can be started
using its own thread. In the latter case, one can easily create multiple
servers in a single process, that listen on different ports.

class RequestServer(threading.Thread):
    """RequestServer(address, async_val=False, verbose=0)

    Setup a simple server that handles requests similar to a telnet server,
    or asyncore. Starting the server using run() will run the server in
    the calling thread. Starting the server using start() will run the
    server in a separate thread.

    To create a server, subclass this class and re-implement the
    handle_request method. It accepts a request and should return a
    reply. This server assumes utf-8 encoded messages.

    Parameters
    ----------
    address : str
        Should be of the shape hostname:port.
    async_val : bool
        If True, handles each incoming connection in a separate thread.
        This might be advantageous if a the handle_request() method
        takes a long time to execute.
    verbose : bool
        If True, print a message each time a connection is accepted.

    Notes on hostname
    -----------------
    The hostname can be:
      * The IP address, or the string hostname of this computer.
      * 'localhost': the connections is only visible from this computer.
        Also some low level networking layers are bypassed, which results
        in a faster connection. The other context should also connect to
        'localhost'.
      * 'publichost': the connection is visible by other computers on the
        same network.
